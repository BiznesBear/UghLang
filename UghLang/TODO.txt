comments rework
rework how nodes are parsed

idea: 
operatorNode calculates value by itself and expression only sort list in right way

NameNode huge rework (parsing)

expressions rework

refrences by type

fix error handling

structs: 
`
struct MyStruct {
	first,
	second,
	third,
}

myStruct : MyStruct = { 2, 3, 4 }; 
`

for loop: for expression1, expression2, expression3 { Code every iteration  }


function decorators and delegates 
function should be type too so this would work: 

`
delegate(x, y) MyDelegate;

fun Main(f:fun, sf:MyDelegate){
	f(); // fun contains no args by defalut
	sf(5, 10); // no error here
}
`

own functionality for lambda expression

enums (loading form modules) 

?? compiling AST's to binary files ??
?? imaginary units ??
