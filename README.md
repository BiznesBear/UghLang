# UghLang
Written in C# interpreted programing language created for educational purpose and to show the power of simplicity.

# Building
Make sure you have .net 9 installed

- `--debug` (enters debug mode)
- `--version` (prints version)
- `--info` or `--help` (displays info about the language)

# Mini documentation
This section is dedicated to the basic functions of the ugh language.

## How brackets work in UghLang
Brackets creates new expression which returns somthing (0 by defalut).

Don't do:
```ugh
print "Hello " + "world!" # This won't work, because ugh (currently) doesn't know that there's a calculation #
```
Do:
```ugh
print("Hello " + "world!") # print keyword prints one single value, not a list of them # 
```

## Keywords list
- print
- input
- free
- true
- false
- fun
- break

- if
- else
- elif
- repeat
- while
- foreach
- insert
- local
- module 
- as
- const

### Declaring variables
```ugh
myVar = 5;
print("myVar equals " + myVar);
```

### Releasing resources
```ugh
# TIP: You can replace name with "all" to release all names. #
myVar = 5;
free myVar;
```

### Math operations
```ugh
myVar = 5; # Set #
myVar + 5; myVar += 5;# Add #
myVar - 5; myVar -= 5;# Subtract #
myVar * 5; myVar *= 5;# Multiply #
myVar / 5; myVar /= 5;# Divide #
myVar ** 2; # Power #
myVar // 2; # Square root #

# PI example #
pi = Ï€; # PI number is aviable also in std as `PI` #
# Remember to put any operator between these names. Comma will also works as well. #
print (2pi * 2pi); # Result: 39,47842 #
```

### If and else and elif
```ugh
if(5 > 3){
	print "5 is higher than 3";
}
elif(5 == 3){
	print "5 equals 3";
}
else {
	print "5 is lower than 3";
}
```

### Repeat
Repeats somthing X times and always changes i variable by 1 or -1.

```ugh
# Basic repeat #
repeat 0, 10 { # This will repeat 10 times #
	print "Hello";
}

# Counts from 0 to 10 #
repeat 0, 10, i {
	print i;
}

# Reversed repeat. Counts from 10 to 0 #
repeat 10, 0, i {
	print i;
}


```

### While
```ugh
myVar = 0;
while(myVar < 10) {
	myVar + 1;
	print myVar;
}
```

### Foreach and arrays
```ugh

myArray = [ "foo", "somthing", "trash" ];
myArray = { "foo", "somthing", "trash" }; # You can also use braces #

foreach item, myArray {
    print item;
}
```

### Fun, return
Remember that every name in UghLang is variable. There's no exception for functions.
```ugh
fun Hello(){
	return "Hello"
}

Hello();
print(Hello + " world!"); # Get value from last hello execution #


myVar = Hello();
print(myVar + " world!");

# The fastest way to do all above #
print(Hello() + " world!");
```

### Insert
```ugh
insert "std"; # You can put any name of ugh file here (or directory which contains source.ugh) #
Helloworld();
```

### Local
```ugh
local fun Foo(){ # Nodes marked as local won't load when inserted from other file # 
	print "Hello, world!";
} 

local { # Example of nested local #

	repeat 100 {
		print "Hello, world!";
	}
}
```

### Constants
```ugh
const MYNUM = 100;
MYNUM += 900; # This operation is readonly #
```

### Modules and As keyword
> [!NOTE]
> Modules are experimental future.

```ugh
module "File" as f;
myVar = f.Read("myFile.txt");
print myVar;
```

### Converting types
```ugh
module "Convert";
myVar = "10";
print(Convert.Int(myVar) + 5);
```

### Lists
```ugh
module "List" as list;

myList = list.New(["foo", "trash"]);

list.Add(myList, "orzech");

foreach item, myList {
	print item;
}
print list.Count(myList);
```


# Examples
## Fibonacci
```ugh
# Fibonacci sequence example #

n = 10; # Lenght #
a = 0;
b = 1; 

repeat 0, n { 
    c = (a + b);
    print c;
    a = b; 
    b = c;   
}
```
